            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
            NoiseCraft is a visual programming language for sound synthesis and music that runs
            in your web browser, loosely inspired by Pure Data and Max/MSP. It's a tool that allows you to build your
            own synthesizer by creating new nodes and connecting them together. By connecting nodes together,
            you control how audio data and control signals flow from one
            node to another and how sound is generated. NoiseCraft is ideally suited to play with additive,
            subtractive and FM synthesis.
            </p>

            <p>
            For those who are new to synthesizers and sound synthesis,
            <a href="https://gizmodo.com/a-beginners-guide-to-the-synth-1736978695">A Beginner's Guide to the Synth</a>
            is a good introduction to the basic concepts involved.
            Please don't hesitate to ask any question, offer feedback or report bugs, by
            <a href="https://github.com/maximecb/noisecraft/issues">opening an issue</a> on our
            GitHub repository. We also welcome open source contributors, although we ask that you please communicate
            with us first before opening pull requests for new features, as we are selective as to what changes will
            be merged.
            </p>

            <h2>The Basics</h2>

            <h3>Starting Audio Generation</h3>
            <p>
            To start generating audio, press the "Play" button in the top-right corner of the page. You can also press
            the spacebar to start and stop generating audio. Note that projects using the <code>MidiIn</code> node may not
            produce any sound until you press keys on your keyboard or on a <a href=#midi_support>MIDI controller</a>.
            Also note that NoiseCraft has been primarily tested and works most reliably with the Chrome web browser.
            </p>

            <h3>Keyboard Shortcuts</h3>
            <p>
            NoiseCraft defines a few useful keyboard shortcuts. On macOS the command key is used instead of control:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Ctrl + A: select all</li>
                <li>Ctrl + C: copy selected nodes</li>
                <li>Ctrl + X: cut selected nodes</li>
                <li>Ctrl + V: paste at cursor position</li>
                <li>Ctrl + S: save project to file</li>
                <li>Ctrl + Z: undo</li>
                <li>Ctrl + Y: redo</li>
                <li>Delete: delete selected nodes</li>
                <li>Spacebar: start/stop generating audio</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Creating New Nodes</h3>
            <p>
            Clicking on empty space in the editor will make a dialog menu pop up which allows you to select the
            kind of node you want to create. Once the node is created, you can drag it around by clicking on the
            node's name and holding the left mouse button as you move the mouse.
            </p>

            <h3>Node Types</h3>
            Each node has input ports on the left, output ports on the right, and performs some operation
            internally. Nodes like Add and Mul will add and multiply two input signals together. <code>Sine</code>,
            <code>Saw</code>, <code>Pulse</code> and <code>Noise</code> are oscillators (signal sources). The
            <code>AudioOut</code> node takes a left and right signal and plays
            it back on your speakers.

            <h3>Connecting Nodes</h3>
            <p>
            Nodes can have input and output ports, represented by orange boxes. By convention, the input ports of
            a node are always on the left side, and the output ports are on the right. You can only connect output
            ports to input ports. One output can be connected to multiple inputs, but each in put can only be
            connected to one output. To make a connection, simply click on the first port to connect, and then
            on the second. A new curved line representing the connection will appear.
            </p>

            <p>
            NoiseCraft does audio synthesis through virtual analog modeling. All values coming out of a node's
            output port are floating-point value that can fluctuate over time. Typically, these values are in
            the range from -1 to 1, or from 0 to 1, but this can vary from one node type to another. Knobs,
            for example, can be configured to output values in any desired range.
            </p>

            <p>
            Connections or wires can have different colors. The colors are meant to make it easier to tell them
            apart visually. The color of the wires is not completely random, it is dependent on the output port
            they are coming from.
            All the wires coming from the same output will have the same color. The color associated with an
            output port is decided based on the node type and the name of the output port, so that two nodes
            of the same type will produce outputs of the same color.
            </p>

            <h3>Selecting Nodes</h3>
            <p>
            To select one or more nodes, press and hold the left mouse button, a red selection box will appear.
            You can then move the mouse while holding the left mouse button pressed to select the nodes you want.
            Release the mouse button when done and the selected nodes will remain highlighted. To deselect the
            nodes, click any empty space in the editor.
            </p>

            <h3>Moving Nodes</h3>
            <p>
            To move a node, click on the node's name and hold down the mouse button while moving the mouse.
            </p>

            <h3>Deleting Nodes</h3>
            <p>
            You can delete nodes by first selecting them and then pressing the delete key.
            </p>

            <h3>Removing Connections</h3>
            <p>
            To break connections, you can click on the input-side port
            associated with that connection. This will break the connection, and leave you holding a dangling
            wire which you can then reconnect to an input port on another node. You can also drop the
            dangling connection by clicking on an empty part of the canvas.
            <p>

            <p>
            It's also possible to override existing connections. In NoiseCraft, output-side ports can be
            connected to multiple inputs, but input-side ports can can only be connected to one thing.
            When you try to connect an output port to an input port that already is connected to something,
            this will remove the previous connection on that input port and override it with the new
            connection you just made.
            </p>

            <h3>Editing Node Parameters</h3>
            <p>
            Double-clicking on a node's name will make a Node Parameters menu specific to this node pop up.
            This allows you to edit advanced parameters, such as the minimum and maximum value a knob can output,
            or the output range of a <code>Sine</code> oscillator.
            </p>

            <h3>Copying and Pasting</h3>
            <p>
            One or more nodes can be copied by first selecting the nodes you want to copy, and then
            pressing Ctrl+C (Command+C on macOS). You can then paste the nodes at the location of your
            mouse pointer by pressing Ctrl+V (Command+V on macOS). You can copy and paste nodes
            between different browser tabs, which makes it possible to reuse useful parts of
            other projects.
            </p>

            <h3>Zooming In and Out</h3>
            <p>
            At this time, there is no zoom feature built into NoiseCraft itself. However, most web
            browsers allow you to zoom in and out on a webpage with Ctrl+Minus and Ctrl+Plus. This
            works fairly well to zoom out on larger projects.
            </p>

            <h2>Examples</h2>

            This section contains some simple example projects which can serve as mini tutorials to
            help you get started.

            <h3>Producing Sound</h3>
            <p>
            In order to produce a sound, we need to connect an audio signal source to an audio output. The
            <a href="https://noisecraft.app/161">simplest possible graph</a> that you could make to do this
            involves connecting a <code>Noise</code> node directly to an <code>AudioOut</code> node. Try
            creating this simple graph, and then press the Play button in the top-right corner.
            </p>

            <h3>Volume Knob</h3>
            <p>
            It's useful to be able to change the amplitude (intensity) of a signal. An easy way to do this
            is to multiply that signal by some number. In <a href="https://noisecraft.app/162">this example</a>,
            we multiply the output of a <code>Noise</code> node by some factor that is controlled by a
            <code>Knob</code> node. You can
            change the value that the knob outputs by clicking on the knob, holding the mouse button
            down and moving your mouse up and down. Knobs, by default, produce values between 0 and 1.
            However, you can change the output range of a knob by double clicking on its name (where it
            says "Knob") and editing the node's parameters.
            </p>

            <h3>Low Frequency Oscillators (LFOs)</h3>
            <p>
            The <code>Sine</code>, <code>Saw</code> and <code>Tri</code> oscillator nodes can be used as LFOs.
            You can double-click on these nodes to edit their minimum and maximum output range,
            and then use their output to modulate the parameters of other nodes. In this simple example,
            we use a sine LFO to <a href="https://noisecraft.app/164">modulate the cutoff</a> of a low-pass
            filter.
            </p>

            <h3>Sequencers</h3>
            <p>
            Sequencers can be used to automatically play a sequence of notes, or for automation.
            Each sequencer contains 8 patterns that can be selected using the buttons numbered 1
            through 8. The patterns can be extended or shortened in length. The frequency output
            of the sequencer corresponds to a note on the currently selected scale, and can be
            used to <a href="https://noisecraft.app/243">drive an oscillator</a>. A simple detuning
            effect can be achieved by multiplying the frequency by a value or by adding to it.
            </p>

            <!--
            <h3>Playing Some Notes</h3>
            <p>
            The MidiIn node allows you to get pitch and gate inputs for notes played on a computer keyboard
            or MIDI input device. The pitch value is the frequency of the note played. The gate value is one
            when a key is held down, or zero otherwise.
            </p>

            <p>
            This <a href="#31">example graph</a> uses the pitch value to directly control
            a sawtooth wave oscillator. The gate value is then multiplied by the oscillator's output, so
            that you only hear a sound when a note is playing.
            </p>

            <p>Press the play button in the top-right corner, and then try pressing the A to L keys on
            your keyboard to produce sound. You can also shift one octave up or down with the Z and X keys.
            If you want to use a MIDI input device, you should connect this device to your computer
            before loading up NoiseCraft (or refresh the page).
            </p>
            -->

            <h2>MIDI Support</h2>
            <h3>Keyboard and Sequencers</h3>
            <p>
            NoiseCraft can receive input from MIDI keyboards, sequencers and other types of MIDI devices. The
            <code>MidiIn</code> node, by default, will connect to every MIDI device on your system and receive notes.
            </p>

            <h3>Mapping Controls</h3>
            <p>
            You can map virtual knobs in NoiseCraft to physical knobs or faders on a MIDI device by
            double-clicking on the virtual knob and then moving the physical knob you want to map to.
            You can also map knobs to the mod wheel or pitch bend wheel of a MIDI keyboard. In cases
            where you can't easily physically move a specific physical control to bind it, it's also
            possible to double-click on a knob's header to open the node parameters menu, and then
            manually edit the <code>controlId</code> parameter.
            </p>

            <h3>Unmapping Controls</h3>
            <p>
            To unmap a MIDI control from a virtual knob, double click the knob node and then click outside of
            the mapping dialog or press the escape key.
            </p>

            <h3>Supported Devices</h3>
            <p>
            Most MIDI controllers should work with NoiseCraft out of the box, but if you are looking to purchase
            new equipment, I have personally tested the Novation Launch Control, which has multiple mappable knobs,
            the M-Audio KeyStation 88, the Akai MPK Mini and the Arturia KeyStep.
            </p>
